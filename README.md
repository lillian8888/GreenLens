## Description and Use Case
GreenLens is a convenient and easily accessible Chrome extension that can be used on any webpage. Once the user is on an e-commerce webpage of a product, they can analyze the “sustainability score” of the product. This score is based on specific factors that impact the carbon footprint such as: the emissions from production, the sourcing of the materials, transportation emissions, packaging and the life of the product. Initially, there is a brief summary and explanation for the overall score shown. Then, a breakdown of each of these factors is provided, and when you click on a factor, the user can see exactly why this factor has that specific score for that specific product, and tips on how this score can be improved on future purchases. Additionally, the carbon footprint generated from the production and shipping of that product is also calculated and displayed. We have also provided a way to track the carbon footprint generated by the user by purchasing these products, which is currently calculated by the ‘add to cart’ function but when deploying the extension, it will be based on whether the user actually purchased the product. This function aggregates the carbon footprint and shows the user their overall value. 
An additional feature we added is the points feature, which allows the user to gain points for more sustainable choices. These points can be used to obtain certain rewards and benefits.  This makes the extension more exciting for users and motivates them to continue using it.

##Challenges and Solutions
One of the major challenges we ran into early on was that one of our team members exceeded the usage limit for Claude AI, which might’ve greatly limited the capabilities of our team. We were, however, able to split up the tasks effectively such that we distributed the work efficiently and were able to successfully complete all the tasks while maximizing the possibilities of our product. 
Another issue we ran into was with the code regarding the drop-down for the expanded description of factors. The initial couple tries for this feature did not work, and this made it very difficult since we had to generate multiple different prompts until we found the right one that generated a working drop down list with tips and a detailed description.
